# tube_analysis
For use of analyzing the structure of assembly discrete tubes.

The file tube_analysis.py is a collection of functions that can be used in the analysis of tubes. The "__main__" of this script is an example of how to use the various functions if you have TEM images of tubes to start with. A critical part of the analysis uses pre-generated .pkl files that contain refernce arrays. The end-user will have to generate their own .pkl files to use for analysis since there is a file limit on Git Hub. If you are a member of the Rogers lab there is a storage location for these .pkl files that you can transfer to your work folder.
